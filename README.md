# Phonebook with Authorization on Redux Toolkit
This educational project "Phonebook" is implemented using a ready-made backend connections-api.herokuapp.com, which supports operations with a collection of contacts, as well as registration, login, and user update using JWT. Routing is done using the React Router library, and authorization and logging are implemented with Redux Toolkit.
