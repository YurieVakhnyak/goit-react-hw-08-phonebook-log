# Phonebook with Authorization on Redux Toolkit

This educational project "Phonebook" is implemented using a ready-made backend

contacts, as well as registration, login, and user update using JWT. Routing is
done using the React Router library, and authorization and logging are
implemented with Redux Toolkit.
